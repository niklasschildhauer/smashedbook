# SmashedBook
A simple app to collect recipes and generate a eat plan for the week. It is my own little Playground project. 

I am mainly using it to explore the possibilities of SwiftUI. Which UIKit patterns are still applicable or necessary? How to decouple the different views and which component is responsible for what?

It is also a playground for writing a small backend, deploying the infrastructure with CDKTF and trying out Azure resources.
